```
# Image to Pencil Sketch Converter using Python

Convert your images into artistic pencil sketches with this simple Python script.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to use Python to transform regular images into pencil sketches. It utilizes basic image processing techniques to achieve the desired effect. The script takes an input image and produces an output pencil sketch version of the same image.

## Features

- Convert any image to a pencil sketch
- Adjust the intensity and contrast of the sketch
- Save the generated pencil sketch as an image file

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages: OpenCV, NumPy

Install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
https://github.com/rakshana-07/LGMVIP--DataScience-TASK-04
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd image-to-pencil-sketch
```

3. Place the image you want to convert in the project directory.

4. Run the script:

```bash
python sketch_converter.py dog_Image.png
```

Replace `dog_Image.png` with the name of your image file.

5. The pencil sketch will be generated and saved as `output_sketch.jpg` in the same directory.

## Customization

You can adjust the intensity and contrast of the sketch by modifying the parameters in the `sketch_converter.py` script. Experiment with different values to achieve the desired effect.

## Examples

Original Image             |  Pencil Sketch
